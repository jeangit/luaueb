## Purpose
It's for generating web sites.

More exactly, generating web pages with patterns.

It's useful if you have a static website, in several languages.

## Prerequisite
You must have Lua installed.

It should work with all flavors of Lua if > 5.1 .

## Using
Prepare a directory _templates_ containing your sources files and the patterns files.

See the _templates_ directory for a sample.

And then, you launch `./luaweb` and here you go.
